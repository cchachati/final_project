# The Syrian Civil war

This project analyzes the deaths over the course of the Syrian civil war according to certain demographic, 
political and geographic variables. 

More specifically, this project analyzes the deaths from March 2011 until September 2018.
It tracks deaths over time and compares total deaths by gender, age, cause of death, 
political affiliation, location, and whether the person was a civilian or combatant. 
The data suggests that the highest death toll occured between 2011 and 2012, and coincided with 
an increase in conflict in Aleppo and the Damascus suburbs. 
In addition, from the onset of the Syrian civil war, the highest number of deaths occured among adult
male citizens in Aleppo and the Damascus suburbs as a result of shelling or shooting. 

### Information on the Syrian civil war

The Syrian civil war began in the backdrop of the so called Arab Spring.
The first protests were in Daraa after 15 boys were allegedly detained and tortured for 
spray painting anti-government slogans at their school. 
Syria, however, quickly became a battleground not only between the Assad regime and
domestic opposition, but also between Islamists and international actors.

Syria has become the center for proxy wars among both state and non state actors.
At various points during the war, the Assad regime was fighting against the Kurds
in the north, the Free Syrian Army, and the Islamists such as al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Army of Islam. 
Primarily, the Assad regime is supported by the so called Axis of Resistance: 
Russia, Iran, Hizbullah, and their allies in the region. Whereas, the Free Syrian Army
is supported by the US, European countries and the Gulf. 
These actors have different objectives ranging from preserving the status quo, 
to territorial and ideological control. 

The conflict particularly intensified between 2011 and 2012 when anti-government forces
gained control in parts of Aleppo and Damascus. 
The death toll and conflict also increased with the rise of ISIS and their seige of
Palmyra and Raqqa in 2014. 
Currently, in 2018, the Assad regime and its allies have regained the majority of Syria.
